# State-fullness

<b>app -> statefull_widget</b>

A widget is either stateful or stateless. If a widget can change—when a user interacts with it, for example—it’s stateful.

A *stateless* widget never changes. [Icon](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon-class.html), [IconButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html), and [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) are examples of stateless widgets. Stateless widgets subclass [StatelessWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html).

A *stateful* widget is dynamic: for example, it can change its appearance in response to events triggered by user interactions or when it receives data. [Checkbox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Checkbox-class.html), [Radio](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Radio-class.html), [Slider](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Slider-class.html), [InkWell](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InkWell-class.html), [Form](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Form-class.html), and [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) are examples of stateful widgets. Stateful widgets subclass [StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html).

A widget’s state is stored in a [State](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html) object, separating the widget’s state from its appearance. The state consists of values that can change, like a slider’s current value or whether a checkbox is checked. When the widget’s state changes, the state object calls `setState()`, telling the framework to redraw the widget.

- A stateful widget is implemented by two classes: a subclass of `StatefulWidget` and a subclass of `State`.

- The state class contains the widget’s mutable state and the widget’s `build()` method.

- When the widget’s state changes, the state object calls `setState()`, telling the framework to redraw the widget.

  

  In this example, toggling the star is an isolated action that doesn’t affect the parent widget or the rest of the UI, so the widget can handle its state internally.

## Creating subclass to StatefulWidget

```dart
class FavoriteWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FavoriteWidgetState createState() => _FavoriteWidgetState();
}
```

## Creating subclass to State

The `_FavoriteWidgetState` class stores the mutable data that can change over the lifetime of the widget. When the app first launches, the UI displays a solid red star, indicating that the lake has “favorite” status, along with 41 likes. These values are stored in the `_isFavorited` and `_favoriteCount` fields:

```dart
class _FavoriteWidgetState extends State<FavoriteWidget> {
  bool _isFavorited = true;
  int _favoriteCount = 41;
  // ···
}
```

The class also defines a `build()` method, which creates a row containing a red `IconButton`, and `Text`. You use [IconButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html) (instead of `Icon`) because it has an `onPressed` property that defines the callback function (`_toggleFavorite`) for handling a tap.

```dart
class _FavoriteWidgetState extends State<FavoriteWidget> {
  // ···
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
      children: [
        Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(0),
          child: IconButton(
            icon: (_isFavorited ? Icon(Icons.star) : Icon(Icons.star_border)),
            color: Colors.red[500],
            onPressed: _toggleFavorite,
          ),
        ),
        SizedBox(
          width: 18,
          child: Container(
            child: Text('$_favoriteCount'),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

Placing the `Text` in a [SizedBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SizedBox-class.html) and setting its width prevents a discernible “jump” when the text changes between the values of 40 and 41 — a jump would otherwise occur because those values have different widths.

The `_toggleFavorite()` method, which is called when the `IconButton` is pressed, calls `setState()`. Calling `setState()` is critical, because this tells the framework that the widget’s state has changed and that the widget should be redrawn. 

```dart
void _toggleFavorite() {
  setState(() {
    if (_isFavorited) {
      _favoriteCount -= 1;
      _isFavorited = false;
    } else {
      _favoriteCount += 1;
      _isFavorited = true;
    }
  });
}
```

## Adding the statefull widget in place of stateless widget

```dart
Widget titleSection = Container (
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(32),
      child: Row (
        children: [
          Expanded(  //the first child inside the row  -> contains 2 rows of texts
            child: Column(
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
              children: [
                Container(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 8),
                    child: Text(
                        'Oeschinen Lake Campground',
                        style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)) //The Heading,
                ),
                Text(  //the subtext
                  'Kandersteg, Switzerland',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey[500]),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          FavoriteWidget(),
        ],
      ),
    );
```
