# Managing State-full widgets

There are several valid ways to make your widget interactive. You, as the widget designer, make the decision based on how you expect your widget to be used. Here are the most common ways to manage state:

- [The widget manages its own state](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive#self-managed)
- [The parent manages the widget’s state](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive#parent-managed)
- [A mix-and-match approach](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive#mix-and-match)

How do you decide which approach to use? The following principles should help you decide:

- If the state in question is user data, for example the checked or unchecked mode of a checkbox, or the position of a slider, then the state is best managed by the parent widget.
- If the state in question is aesthetic, for example an animation, then the state is best managed by the widget itself.

If in doubt, start by managing state in the parent widget.

## Starting with widget handling its own state:

There will be a state class for the widget class that will hold the state information of the widget object and will alter it when interacted with. Here we have widget: TapboxA and its state class : _TapboxAState. 

_TapboxAState:

- manage state of TapboxA
- handle the interaction using the _handleTap() method
- the _handleTap() method will also call setState() method wchich will update the UI to show the new state.

Creating our widget:

```dart
class TapboxA extends StatefulWidget {
  TapboxA({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _TapboxAState createState() => _TapboxAState();
}
```

Creating our widget state to handle the on click functionality (denoted in the code as -`onTap`)of the above widget.

```dart
class _TapboxAState extends State<TapboxA> {
  bool _active = false;

  void _handleTap() {
    setState(() {
      _active = !_active;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: _handleTap,
      child: Container(
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            _active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32.0, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
        width: 200.0,
        height: 200.0,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: _active ? Colors.lightGreen[700] : Colors.grey[600],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

<b>Note: Here the function `_handletap` only calls the setState() method and toggles the active state. This setState() method then calls the build() function of the `_TapboxAState` class . This way the widget is redrawn</b> 

adding the above widget into our app body. 

```dart
home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TapboxA(),
        ),
      ),
```

## Parent Widget handling a child widget state

Here we will create TapboxB widget, whose state will be handled by the parent widget i.e. our main body widget.

Here as TapBoxB is not handling or storing its own widget state information that is why i will subclass StatelessWidget in place of StatefullWidget as in the case of TapboxA.

Parent class will:

- implement `_handleTapboxChanged()` method to handle the state change and will pass this function as an argument when creating the child button object

- call the `setState()` function when it has to redraw the new state of the child widget and also updated the state info of the child which it stores . 

  <b>Note: The state info present (if any) inside the child widget are never altered. They have been set to final</b>

  <b>Note: When the setState() function is called it re-calls the build() function. Thus the child object is re-created inside that function and this way it is redrawn</b>

Here TapboxB will notify the parent widget if it receives any tap in place of handling it itself.

create the parent widget:

```dart
class ParentWidgetB extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ParentWidgetBState createState() => _ParentWidgetBState();
}

class _ParentWidgetBState extends State<ParentWidgetB> {
  bool _tapBoxBActive = false;
  TapboxB tapboxB;

  void _handleTapBoxBChanged() {
    setState(() {
      _tapBoxBActive = !_tapBoxBActive;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    tapboxB = TapboxB(active: _tapBoxBActive, onChanged: _handleTapBoxBChanged);

    return Container(
      child: tapboxB,
    );
  }
}
```

create the tapbox widget

```dart
class TapboxB extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool active;
  final Function onChanged;

  TapboxB({Key key, this.active: false, @required this.onChanged})
      : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: onChanged,
      child: Container(
        child: Center(
            child: Text(
          active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32, color: Colors.white),
        )),
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        decoration:
            BoxDecoration(color: active ? Colors.green[700] : Colors.grey[600]),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```



## Mix and Match method

 In this scenario, the stateful widget manages some of the state, and the parent widget manages other aspects of the state. 

In the `TapboxC` example, on tap down, a dark green border appears around the box. On tap up, the border disappears and the box’s color changes. `TapboxC` exports its `_active` state to its parent but manages its `_highlight` state internally. This example has two State objects, `_ParentWidgetState` and `_TapboxCState`.
